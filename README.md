Library for 74HC4067 Mux/Demux Control

The CD74HC4067 is a high-speed CMOS Logic 16-Channel Analog Multiplexer/Demultiplexer that features 16 channels of selectable inputs/outputs. The routing of common signal to independent I/O is set by digitally controlling 4 select lines, which can be set either H or L into one of 16 binary combinations. The chip allows to connect up to 16 analog sources to 4 pins on the microcontroller.
